        <h2>Rules<pre>Failure to follow these will result in your name getting blacklisted.</pre></h2>
        <h3>Our anarchy vm, VM0, is governed by a <a href="vm0rules.html">seperate set of rules.</a></h3>
          <p>1. Don't break the laws of the United States or the State of Virginia.<pre>I WILL shut down these VMs permanently if somebody decides to open CP on them.</pre></p>
          <p>2. Don't run overused garbage. (e.g. Monoxide, rd c:\ /s /q, mountvol c: /d, tin.exe, etc.)<pre>Adware, PUPs, and other <b>non-destructive</b> programs are allowed.</pre></p>
          <p>3. Installing other remote access tools is forbidden. (TightVNC, RUDesk, etc.)</p>
          <p>4. If somebody is trying to do something, don't be an asshole and close it out.</p>
          <p>5. I reserve the right to disconnect Internet access and/or shut the VM down at any time. Please don't contact me saying "PLS PUT VM BACK UP NOW."</p>
          <p>6. <b>No NSFW content. Yes that includes gore.</b></p>
          <p>7. No reinstalling/installing/uninstalling the OS. If you want a new VM you can contact me through the <a href="Contact.html">contact</a> page.</p>
          <p>8. No cryptomining on our VMs. You're not gonna earn money off it anyways...</p>
